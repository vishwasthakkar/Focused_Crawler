# Focused_Crawler
This python based application crawls through the given seed web page and extracts relevant links from the source code.
The relavance can be determined by giving a keyphrase as input to the crawler. The crawler will check whether that keyphrase is 
present in a particular page or not. 

You can also do a full crawl instead of a focused crawl. That meas you don't need to find relevant pages but all the URLs that are
present in the crawled pages.

Libraries used : requests, bs4
